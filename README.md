# Age-to-dog-years-calculator

To use code, create new project in VS and use C# Console App (.NET Framework). Paste code from Program.cs (Github version) into your Program.cs file within VS. Should run without issues.

This program allows you to translate your age into dog years. This program runs with the idea that 1 human year is equal to 15 dog years (some people will not allow the translation to use whole numbers).
